It's been around for a while, and I've tried on several occasions to use it.  Recently, I (and Qtile) made enough progress that it's reliable and efficient to use as my daily driver.

&lt;p&gt;You can watch a short and droll video about Qtile from 2011 on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_8om4dsEmw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its name, Qtile has nothing to do with Qt nor KDE, in fact like most tiling window managers, it replaces a desktop environment.  I was an XFCE user for many years, and more recently made extended trials of KDE and Gnome.  Gnome ran pretty well on my middle-aged Thinkpad, but I found myself needing to use the mouse a bit more than I wanted to, especially because I was trying to use the trackpad instead of toting around a mouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qtile has enabled me to do virtually all my window management using the keyboard with a minimum of effort.  Because I can (when I want) dispense with any chrome or even a bar, Qtile lets me make most efficient use of my limited number of pixels (1368x768).  I tend to be a windows-maximized-all-the-time kind of person, and of course that is easy to work in with Qtile.  When I need to switch to side-by-side or tiled windows, it's just a keyboard shortcut away.&lt;/p&gt;
